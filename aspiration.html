            <h1>Cyber Security Engineer</h1>
            <p>Ever since I was little I was always fascinated by technology, but the main thing that caught my interest was how our privacy was protected online. Even though we live in a world full of technology we've only seen how hackers try hacking into the systems and not how people try defending the systems or how the systems are made. That's what caught my interest because protecting systems take time and effort and I want to keep people's information safe so if you know anyone that would be willing to teach me Cyber Security and how I can develop skills for Cyber Security contact me at ukikke@gmail.com. </p>
